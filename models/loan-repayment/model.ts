/**
 * The EdgeRules DSL of the loan repayment model.
 *
 * - `pricingTier` is the decision table: the credit score and the term select the price tier and the rate premium.
 * - `loanRepayment` is the `@Service`: it prices a `LoanRequest` and returns its monthly repayment schedule. Its flow
 *   shows the `request` parameter, the invocations of its body and the `@ResultNode`: the values it returns. The
 *   intermediate `annuity` and `fullSchedule` stay out of the result.
 * - `mortgageBook` and `termComparisonBook` are the two workbooks that call the service and chart the repayment.
